### Exa
mple Hook Resource

```yaml
apiVersion: kagent.dev/v1alpha2
kind: Hook
metadata:
  name: example-hook
  namespace: production
spec:
  eventConfigurations:
  - eventType: pod-restart
    agentId: kagent/incident-responder
    prompt: |
      AUTONOMOUS MODE: Pod {{.ResourceName}} restarted at {{.EventTime}}. Analyze and fix immediately.
      INSTRUCTIONS:
      • Use all available tools to diagnose and resolve the issue
      • Annotate fixed resources with: kagentFix=<timestamp>
      • If patching fails: delete and recreate resources
      • Never ask for permission - assume autonomous execution
      • Complete remediation without human approval
  - eventType: oom-kill
    agentId: kagent/memory-analyzer
    prompt: |
      AUTONOMOUS MODE: OOM kill for {{.ResourceName}}. Analyze memory and optimize immediately.
      INSTRUCTIONS:
      • Use all available tools to diagnose and resolve memory issues
      • Annotate fixed resources with: kagentFix=<timestamp>
      • If patching fails: delete and recreate resources
      • Never ask for permission - assume autonomous execution
      • Complete remediation without human approval
  - eventType: kustomization-failed
    agentId: kagent/flux-kustomization-responder
    prompt: |
      AUTONOMOUS MODE: Flux Kustomization failed for {{.ResourceName}} at {{.EventTime}}. Reason: {{.EventMessage}}. Diagnose and remediate immediately.
      INSTRUCTIONS:
      • Investigate the failure reason (prune, artifact, build, health check, validation)
      • Use all available tools to resolve the issue
      • Annotate fixed resources with: kagentFix=<timestamp>
      • Never ask for permission - assume autonomous execution
      • Complete remediation without human approval
  - eventType: helm-release-failed
    agentId: kagent/flux-helmrelease-responder
    prompt: |
      AUTONOMOUS MODE: Flux HelmRelease failed for {{.ResourceName}} at {{.EventTime}}. Reason: {{.EventMessage}}. Diagnose and remediate immediately.
      INSTRUCTIONS:
      • Investigate the failure reason (install, upgrade, test, rollback, uninstall, artifact, dependency)
      • Use all available tools to resolve the issue
      • Annotate fixed resources with: kagentFix=<timestamp>
      • Never ask for permission - assume autonomous execution
      • Complete remediation without human approval
status:
  activeEvents:
  - eventType: pod-restart
    resourceName: my-app-pod-123
    firstSeen: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    lastSeen: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    status: firing
  lastUpdated: "2024-01-15T10:30:05Z"
```

### Validation Rules

#### EventConfiguration Validation

- `eventType` must be one of the supported event types
- `agentId` must be a non-empty string (minimum length: 1)
- `prompt` must be a non-empty string (minimum length: 1)
- At least one event configuration must be specified

#### Hook Validation

- Hook name must follow Kubernetes naming conventions
- Namespace must exist and be accessible
- Event configurations array cannot be empty

### Prompt Template Variables

The following variables are available in prompt templates:

| Variable | Type | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `{{.ResourceName}}` | string | Name of the Kubernetes resource | `my-app-pod-123` |
| `{{.EventTime}}` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp of the event | `2024-01-15T10:30:00Z` |
| `{{.Namespace}}` | string | Namespace of the resource | `production` |
| `{{.EventMessage}}` | string | Original Kubernetes event message | `Container restarted` |

### Status Conditions

The Hook status may include the following conditions:

| Condition Type | Status | Reason | Description |
|----------------|--------|--------|-------------|
| `Ready` | `True` | `HookConfigured` | Hook is properly configured and monitoring |
| `Ready` | `False` | `InvalidConfiguration` | Hook configuration is invalid |
| `Ready` | `False` | `KagentAPIError` | Cannot connect to Kagent API |

### RBAC Requirements

The controller requires the following RBAC permissions:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: kagent-hook-controller
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["events"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create"]
- apiGroups: ["kagent.dev"]
  resources: ["hooks"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
- apiGroups: ["kagent.dev"]
  resources: ["hooks/status"]
  verbs: ["get", "update", "patch"]
```
